"""
An international firm that is looking to expand its business in diff. countries across the world has recruited you.
You have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and are tasked with creating an automated script that can extract the
list of all countries in order of their GDPs in billion USDs (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since IMF releases this evaluation twice a year, this code will be used by
the organization to extract the information as it is updated.
Your boss wants you to demonstrate the success of this code by running a query on the database table to display only
the entries with more than a 100 billion USD economy.
Also, you should log in a file with the entire process of execution named etl_project_log.txt.
